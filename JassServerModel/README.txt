This project provides an API for storing and retrieving tasks and categories.
The API is CRUD complete wich facilitates testing but the web api that is supposed to be used to expose it should avoid using delete.
The API is implemented by the Model Manager

In Nutshell we have

CRUD for Areas
CRUD for AreaHistories  
CRUD for Activity
CRUD for ActivityHistories

a special API for getting Lists of Acivites like to-do today.

An something call activity Log... which I think i will remove... is an over kill
